# Organizer
Simple application that organizes a folders content into sub folders, making it easier to find things. Has an auto feature where it sorts into pre-described folders. Any ideas on what to pre-sort would be appreciated, and further updates to this program are just additions to the auto-sort feature. I made this program because I was getting very annoyed with how some of my directories looked. To use this program first run it and choose a directory by pressing browse. Then you can click auto-sort, or you can specify a specific ending of a file type for example - '.PNG' then describe a folder where you would want to save them 'PNG Files', then click move-files and it will sort .PNG files into PNG Files.
